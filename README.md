# Dir_Struct

This project was written on ASP.NET MVC
This project implements a directory struct like in OS.
So you have a primary directory, where can be folders, where can be folders, etc.

User can:
  - browse folders
  - create folders
  - delete folders
  - edit folder name
  - Backup features:
      - download the directory backup as a .txt file
      - upload to the server early downloaded directory from the .txt file
  - browse a list of all folders you have in the directory (without nesting)

Sorry( I forgot to add .gitignore.
It will be better if you don't modify the .txt file yourself.
